# WebDevStudies

- A web app is usually divided in two pieces: frontend and backend;
- The frontend consists the part of the application that interacts with the user;
- The backend is the part that "serves" the frontend on its functionalities;
- The user interacts with the frontend, and the frontend, in order to perform the operations requested by the user, may interact with the backend;

# Frontend

- The frontend is the part of the app that runs on the browser;
- Is made basically of HTML, CSS and javascript, which are the languages that the browser natively supports;
- There are frameworks like React that boosts the productivity in development;
- The React apps, in order to run on the browser, are built, generating a bunch of HTML, CSS and JS codes that the browser can understand and run;
- The entry point of a web app usually is a file named index.html;
- There are many ways to deploy the frontend of a web app, there are some ideas here: https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/ ;
- Also, another good deployment service for the frontend part is Netlify (https://www.netlify.com/);

# Backend

- The backend basically has service that listens for requests of the frontend;
- The requests made to the backend usually follow a pattern defined by its API;
- The backend usually have a database to centralize the app's data and to provide the necessary data to the frontend, which is requested through the service, following the API pattern;
